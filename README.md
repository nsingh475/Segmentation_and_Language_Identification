# Audio Segmentation and Language Identification in Spanish and Highland Puebla Nahuat

### Introduction
This project presents the implementation of Language Identification and Segmentation for Spanish and Highland Puebla Nahuatl audios. The motivation behind this research extends beyond the abstract uses of language segmentation; it seeks practical applications, particularly in the realm of man- 040
aging bilingual radio transmissions. As part of our broader vision, we aim to contribute to the enhancement of radio archival search capabilities. The immediate use case revolves around enabling people to efficiently find programs by searching through transcriptions. The proposed process involves obtaining audio, performing language identification and segmentation, followed by automatic speech recognition (ASR) on the identified segments. This sequential approach lays the foundation for building a comprehensive database structured with key information such as date, time, language, program, segment begin, segment end, and corresponding text. This database, once established, can be easily searched and indexed, opening up new possibilities for efficient and accurate retrieval of information from bilingual radio transmissions.
